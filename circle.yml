## Customize the test machine
machine:
  # Version of ruby to use
  ruby:
    version:
      1.8.7-p358-falcon-perf

  hosts:
    circlehost: 127.0.0.1

  # Add some environment variables
  environment:
    CIRCLE_ENV: test

  override:
    - bundle install: # note ':' here
        timeout: 180 # fail if command has no output for 3 minutes
        # IMPORTANT NOTE: ^^ the timeout modifier above must be
        # double indented (four spaces) from the previous line

  # we automatically cache and restore many dependencies between
  # builds. If you need to, you can add custom paths to cache:
  cache_directories:
    - "custom_1"   # relative to the build directory
    - "~/custom_2" # relative to the user's home directory

## Customize test commands
test:
  override:
    - javaunit test/unit-tests # use PHPunit for testing
  post:
    - bundle exec rake jasmine:ci: # add an extra test type
        environment:
          RAILS_ENV: test
          RACK_ENV: test

## Customize deployment commands

  staging:
    branch: master
